**DeepSource9** is a flexible and expendable point source detection package for radio telescope images. It takes simulated images and catalogs to train a neural network as signal to noise magnifier. Then it can provide a catalog of predicted point sources by thresholding bob detection (TBD).

Before training, it provides a demaned map from true catalogs. The edge and top view of the demand map is shown below:
